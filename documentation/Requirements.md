# Requirements:

- Apache 2.x with mod_rewrite enabled, runs with mod_php and also php5-fpm/fastcgi. I'm pretty sure, it will run on other platforms as well.
- PHP 5.5.x and up with gd (for image processing on the fly), filter and bcmath extension enabled

Dependencies will be installed with composer.
